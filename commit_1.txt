 Choose a hiding place that can be barricaded. In order to prevent the murderer from finding you, barricade the main entry to your hiding area as best as you can. Ideally, there should be a sturdy lock on the inside of the door, and the door should open out so the murderer can't kick it down. You may also want to barricade the door with additional obstacles, like heavy pieces of furniture.[1]

    If your door swings in, it's especially important to barricade it with heavy objects, as the murderer may be able to kick it in.
    While it's good to be able to keep the murderer out, it's also important to think about how you will escape if the murderer does manage to get in. A hiding spot with two exits (like a door and a window) is ideal.[2]
    If you're outside, you may not be able to barricade yourself, but you should still look for a secluded location that you will easily be able to escape from if necessary.
